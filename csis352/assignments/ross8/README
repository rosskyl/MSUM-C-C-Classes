BUILDING THE PROGRAM
    This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
    Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
    executable called 'prog8'

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
    Type 'prog8' at the command prompt after building the program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
    This program creates and implements a HashTable class.  The main function
    tests the class.  HashTable is a hash table list.
    
PROGRAM INPUT
    None
	
PROGRAM OUTPUT
    Outputs various tests onto the screen.
    
PROGRAM DESIGN
    Function and class method input and output, preconditions and postconditions can
    be found in the documentation for each file.
    The hash table was implemented as a hash bucket.  It is 2 dimensional vector.
    If there are any collisions, the item is inserted into the position of hash*2.
    If there is a collision there, the item is inserted into hash*3 and so on.
