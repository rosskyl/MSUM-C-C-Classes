BUILDING THE PROGRAM
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog6'

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog6' at the command prompt after building the program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
   This program will read employee id, name, hours, and wage from the file
   'data' and calculate the gross pay, federal tax, social security, and 
   net pay for each employee and calculate the total gross pay, federal tax,
   social security, and net pay for all employees and output this information
   to a file 'payroll'.
   
PROGRAM INPUT
   All input comes from the file 'input' that must exist prior to the
   execution of the program.  The program will read the input file
   until end of file is reached.  The format of the input file follows:
      Employee ID
      Employee Name
      Employee Hours
      Employee Wage
      
   For Example
      3
      John Doe
      37.8
      7.25
      
PROGRAM OUTPUT
   All output is written to 'payroll' containing the summary information
   and payroll information for each employee.  Summary info includes total
   gross pay, total federal tax, total social security, and total net pay for
   all employees.  Payroll info includes ID, name, hours, wage, gross pay,
   federal tax, social security, and net pay.
   For Example
      Employee Summary Totals
      -----------------------
      Total Gross Pay:                       404.48
      Total Federal Withholding:             121.34
      Total Social Security Withheld:         32.36
      Total Net Pay:                         250.78


      ID   Name                  Hours   Wage   Gross   Fed     SS      Net     
      ---- --------------------  ------  -----  ------  ------  ------  ------

PROGRAM TESTING
   This program was tested with different sets of data.
   
   Checked for a normal set of data in the file
   
   Checked for the number of values exceeding the array size
   
   Checked for data file not existing
   
   Checked for the data file existing but not containing any values
   
   Checked for the data file containing 1 value
   
   If 'data' file is not formatted correctly program will give false results
