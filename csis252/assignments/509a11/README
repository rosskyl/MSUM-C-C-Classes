BUILDING THE PROGRAM
    This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
    Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
    executable called 'prog11'

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
    Type 'prog11' at the command prompt after building the program.
    Also need the input filename after 'prog11'.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
    This program will read a max test score and students' names, dragon ID,
    and test score from the input file and output their name, dragon ID,
    score, percentage, and grade to the cout.
    
PROGRAM INPUT
    Input comes from the given input file.  Input needs to be in the form:
	maxScore
	name;dragonID;score
	last, first;dragonID;score
	
PROGRAM OUTPUT
    This program will output each student's name, dragon ID, score, 
    percentage, and grade along with headers.
    
PROGRAM DESIGN
    This program uses the ADTs binaryTree and binarySearchTree.  All students
    are stored in a binarySearchTree.

    The general algorithm
	read the input file for max score
	read input file for each student
	print each student's info calculating the percentage and grade

    Function input and output, preconditions and postconditions can
    be found in the documentation for each file.

PROGRAM TESTING
    This program was tested with different sets of data.  

    Checked for a normal set of data in the file
   
    Checked for data file not existing
   
    Checked for the data file existing but not containing any values
   
    Checked for the data file containing 1 value
    
    Checked for not enough arguments

    There are no known bugs
