This example shows the STL list storing pointers to Circle objects.
Circle pointers can be either a pointer to a Circle or a ColoredCircle.

Once the list is populated with pointers to both Circles and ColoredCircles,
it retrieves each and the appropriate Display method is called because
of polymorphism.
