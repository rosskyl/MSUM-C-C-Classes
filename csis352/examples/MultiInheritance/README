Multiple Inheritance is a controversial topic.  Some computer programming
languages do not allow it, Java included.  C++ does allow multiple
inheritance.  Proponents argue that it can be a powerful programming tool
in the hands of skilled programmers.  Detractors argue that it is often
not used properly leading to poor design and code that is difficult
to debug.

ex1.cpp  Shows an example of multiple inheritance.
ex2.cpp  Shows an example of the Deadly Diamond of Derivation (DDD). 
         Members of the class 'base' are ambiguous members of the class
         'multi' because there are two base objects, one inherited
         through 'derived1' and the other inherited through 'derived2'
         This example will not compile.
ex3.cpp  Shows ex2.cpp with the ambiguity resolved with scope resolution.
         This example also shows that there is indeed the existance of
         two 'base' objects.  There may be cases where two base objects
         are desireable.
ex4.cpp  Shows an example of a single 'base' object being inherited by
         'multi' accomplished using virtual inheritance.
ex5.cpp  Example shows that the 'base' constructor is not passed an
         argument when virtual inheritance is used.  Therefore, the
         base constructor must have a default argument. In fact, the
         base constructor does not need to be in the initializer list.
         
Example of multiple inheritance: iostream inherits from both istream
and ostream.  istream and ostream inherit from ios.
