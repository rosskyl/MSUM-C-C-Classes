The purpose of this example is to show another example of the use
of an abstract class.

This example shows a playingCard displayed on a VT100 terminal.  
The main function instantiates a new object of vt100 with a Display
pointer pointing to it.  Should the game be ported to a different
platform with a different kind of display, such as a graphic display,
the game would not need to be changed at all.  Only a new class would
need to be created for the display and instantiated in the main function.

Try it!  Change "new vt100" to "new vtAlt"
