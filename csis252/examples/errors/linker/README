This example contains a linker error.  The linker error occurs because
the implementation for the Circle class is contained in the same file
(circle.h) with the definition (specification).  Since both main.cpp 
and func.cpp both include circle.h, they compile correctly but a linker
error occurs due to multiple definitions of each Circle method.  In other
words, when main.o and func.o are linked together, they both contain
the Circle class implementation.

To prevent a linker error, the class must be compiled separately. The file
circle.h should contain only the definition (specification) of the class
and circle.cpp should contain the implementation.  circle.cpp is compiled
separately and circle.h is included by main.cpp and func.cpp.
