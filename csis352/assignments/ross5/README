BUILDING THE PROGRAM
    This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
    Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
    executable called 'prog5'

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
    Type 'prog5' at the command prompt after building the program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
    This program creates and implements an array class.  The main function
    tests the class.
    
PROGRAM INPUT
    None
	
PROGRAM OUTPUT
    Outputs various tests onto the screen.
    
PROGRAM DESIGN
    Function and class method input and output, preconditions and postconditions can
    be found in the documentation for each file.
    The vertices are stored in a vector.  Each edge is stored as an adjacency list.
    The adjacency list is stored as a vector of pointers to a map of ints to ints.
    Each map contains the index of the adjacent vertex mapping to the weight of the edge.
