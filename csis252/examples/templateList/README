This example is the same as listADT and listADT2 except that it
uses a templated list class instead of using typedef.

NOTE: Templated classes must be compiled into the code that uses it.
It cannot be compiled separately because the compiler would not know
what the data type is for the template.  That is why the entire class
ADT for the list is contained within the file arrayListType.h (both the 
class specification and implementation).  Again, the list class is
NOT compiled, it is only included into the code that uses it.
