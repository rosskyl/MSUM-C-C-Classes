BUILDING THE PROGRAM
    This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
    Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
    executable called 'prog10'

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
    Type 'prog10' at the command prompt after building the program.
    Also need the input filename and output filename after 'prog10'.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
    This program will read sentences from the input file and output
    them to the output file along with whether or not they are a 
    palindrome.
    
PROGRAM INPUT
    Input comes from the given input file.  Input is a sentence including all
    spaces until a period or the end of file is read.
    
PROGRAM OUTPUT
    Output is if the sentence is a palindrome and then a sentence. For example:
	palindrome
	-----------------
	racecar.
	
	
	-----------------
	hello.
	
PROGRAM DESIGN
    This program uses the ADT arrayListType.  All sentences are stored in a 
    list of type arrayListType.

    The general algorithm
	read the input file for sentences and store them into an arrayListType
        output sentences

    Function input and output, preconditions and postconditions can
    be found in the documentation for each file.

PROGRAM TESTING
    This program was tested with different sets of data.  

    Checked for a normal set of data in the file
   
    Checked for data file not existing
   
    Checked for the data file existing but not containing any values
   
    Checked for the data file containing 1 value
    
    Checked for not enough arguments

    There are no known bugs
