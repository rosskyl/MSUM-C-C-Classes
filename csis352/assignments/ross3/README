    This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
    Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
    executable called 'prog3'

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
    Type 'prog3' at the command prompt after building the program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
    This program creates and implements an array class.  The main function
    tests the class.
    
PROGRAM INPUT
