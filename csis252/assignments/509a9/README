BUILDING THE PROGRAM
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog9'

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog9' at the command prompt after building the program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
   This program will read employee info from the file 'data' and calculate
   payroll info including gross pay, federal tax, social security, and net pay
   and output this info to the file 'payroll'

PROGRAM INPUT
   All input comes from the file 'data' that must exist prior to the
   execution of the program.  The program will read the input file
   until end of file is reached.  The format of the input file follows:
      Employee Name
      Employee Birthdate (yyyy-mm-dd format)
      Employee Hourly Wage
      Employee Hours
   For example:
      Barb Wire
      1975-5-1
      40
      10.75
      Nick O. Time
      1985-2-16
      30
      9.50
   
PROGRAM OUTPUT
   All output is written to 'payroll' containing the summary. This
   includes the name, birth year, hours, wage, gross pay, federal tax,
   social security, and net pay for each employee
   For example:
      Name                  Year  Hours   Wage    Gross  FedTax   SSTax     Net
      -------------------  ----- ------ ------ -------- ------- ------- -------
      Barb Wire             1975  40.00  10.75   430.00  129.00   34.40  266.60
      Nick O. Time          1985  30.00   9.50   285.00   85.50   22.80  176.70

PROGRAM DESIGN
   This program uses the ADT arrayListType.  The class employeeType inherits 
   from class personType.  Class personType has a composition of dateType.
   All employees are stored in a list of type arrayListType.

   The general algorithm
      read the employees into an arrayListType
      output employee info

   Function input and output, preconditions and postconditions can
   be found in the documentation for each file.

PROGRAM TESTING
   This program was tested with different sets of data.  

   Checked for a normal set of data in the file
   
   Checked for the number of values exceeding the array size
   
   Checked for data file not existing
   
   Checked for the data file existing but not containing any values
   
   Checked for the data file containing 1 value

   There are no known bugs
