Dynamic memory in a class
   This example demonstrates the execution of the following:
   1) constructor
   2) destructor
   3) copy constructor
   4) operator=
   The output to the screen shows when each of the above are executed.
   If the above are not supplied by the programmer, a default for each is
   supplied by C++.  Since this example uses a dynamically allocated array
   for the intarray, it is necessary for the programmer to supply them.

   The destructor is called whenever an object goes out of scope.

   The copy constructor is called for the following examples:
       * Classname anObject=anotherObject;
       * Classname anObject(anotherObject);
       * when an object is a pass by value argument
       * when an object is returned by a function

   The operator= is called in the following example:
       * anObject = anotherObject;
