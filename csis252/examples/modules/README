BUILDING THE PROGRAM
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog'

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog' at the command prompt after building the program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
   This program will read ints from the file 'data' and summary
   will be written to the file 'results'  This includes the ints
   themselves, the average value, and the biggest value.

PROGRAM INPUT
   All input comes from the file 'data' that must exist prior to the
   execution of the program.  The program will read the input file
   until end of file is reached.  The format of the input file follows:
      int1
      int2
      ...
      intN
   For example:
      5
      4 6
      3
   
PROGRAM OUTPUT
   All output is written to 'results' containing the summary. This
   includes the array itself, the average of the values, the biggest 
   value, and the sorted array.

   For example:
      numbers in the array: 5 4 6 3 
      average is 4.50
      the biggest is 6
      sorted array: 3 4 5 6 

PROGRAM DESIGN
   This program stores all the ints in an array.

   The general algorithm
      read the ints into an array
      output the array
      output the average
      output the biggest
      sort the array
      output the array

   Function input and output, preconditions and postconditions can
   be found in the documentation for each file.

FILE INDEX

   --------------   -----------------  ----------------------
   biggest.cpp      biggest            returns the biggest value in the array
   
   constants.h                         constant declarations
   
   data                                the input file
   
   findavg.cpp      findavg            returns the average value in the array
                    findsum            returns the sum of the array

   main.cpp         main               calls all other functions
   
   NOTES                               describes purpose of this class example

   output.cpp       output             outputs results to the file 'results'
   
   read.cpp         read               read the file 'data' into the array

   sort.cpp         sort               sorts the array ascendingly

   makefile                            builds executable

   results                             file created containing output


PROGRAM TESTING
   This program was tested with different sets of data.  

   Checked for a normal set of data in the file
   
   Checked for the number of values exceeding the array size
   
   Checked for data file not existing
   
   Checked for the data file existing but not containing any values
   
   Checked for the data file containing 1 value

   There are no known bugs.  Any errors should be reported to:
